# Game of Life

A parallel implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life "Wikipedia") .

This project was part of my "Parallel Systems" course during Fall semester 2016.

MPI and OpenMP are being used to achieve parallelism.

Note: "machines" file contains a list with entries of the following type: *<machine_name>:<number_of_cores_to_be_used>*
